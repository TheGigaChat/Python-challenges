# Python Projects

This repository contains various Python projects developed as part of my coursework at TalTech University. The exercises are divided into **mandatory** and **optional** tasks. The mandatory exercises were designed to teach the basics of Python syntax and programming logic, while the optional exercises (marked as **op**) offer more complex challenges.

Each Python file contains detailed descriptions of specific tasks, which can be found inside the `.py` files as f-strings.

## Project Structure

The projects are organized into folders named according to their exercise numbers:

- **ex01_beginnings**: Introduction to Python basics, focusing on variables, basic data types, and simple operations.
- **ex02_loops**: Exploring loop structures (for, while) and their use cases.
- **ex03_validation**: Implementing validation techniques using if statements and logical operators.
- **ex04_lists**: Learning about lists, list operations, and indexing.
- **ex05_personal_data**: A project that manages personal data such as phone numbers and emails, emphasizing string manipulation and formatting.
- **ex06_dictionaries**: Airport timetable project that utilizes dictionaries for data storage and manipulation of time-related information.
- **ex07_regex**: Applying regular expressions for pattern matching and validating input formats such as emails and phone numbers.

### Optional Projects (Advanced)
- **op_projects**: Contains optional exercises that go beyond the basics and involve more advanced problem-solving tasks. These projects focus on integrating various concepts such as data manipulation, file handling, and complex logic.
